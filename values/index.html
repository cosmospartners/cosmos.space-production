            <h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>Cosmos was a values-driven company, meaning that we factored our values into our decision making and actions at all levels of the organization. This manifested in many ways: we assessed candidates for values alignment during recruitment, we designed partner communications with values in mind, and we regularly held <a href="#values-congresses">Values Congresses</a> to continually evolve them, refine them, and keep them in our collective consciousness.</p>
<p>The values were originally defined to prepare for the onboarding of Cosmos&rsquo;s first staff member, with the goal of balancing the inherent power dynamic between partners and staff. We chose to define a larger collection of values than most other companies so that we could precisely communicate the foundation of our thoughts and actions. There were several efforts made to distill the values into a smaller set, but each time the team decided to preserve the original collection.</p>

<h1 id="values-congresses">Values Congresses</h1>
<p>We thought of our values as a system, not a simple list of definitions. This system had two goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal | The values reflect the views of Cosmonauts</li>
<li>Goal | The values are incorporated into decisions and actions</li>
</ul>
<p>The concept of Values Congresses was created to achieve these goals. Each Values Congress was a meeting where the entire team came together to discuss values and any topics related to those values. In the early days we came together for ad-hoc discussions about each value to reflect on how it related to our work.</p>
<p>Values Congresses became more formalized as the team grew â€” we assigned a Congress Conductor who was responsible for ensuring that a successful Values Congress took place, and they in turn were responsible for assigning a Subject Manager. The Subject Manager would choose a subject, create a document with topics to explore that subject, and then share it with the entire team a week before the Values Congress. This gave everyone a chance to reflect on the presented concepts and gather their thoughts. During the Value Congress we discussed topics and prompts, often breaking into smaller groups to ensure that everyone could share their perspective. Then, a Summarizer reviewed all of our discussions, created a summary, and proposed next steps to integrate our collective insights into our daily work.</p>
<p>This model was very successful because it provided a loose framework that enabled the values system to evolve over time. We ultimately held 24 Values Congresses between mid-2019 and late-2023 on topics ranging from the privacy of personal information discussed within Cosmos to the usage of the pronoun &ldquo;we&rdquo; in our writing to indicate that we&rsquo;re writing from the point of view of Cosmos. This subject, coined the <em>Cosmos We</em>, is an apt distillation of the values system. It held us to a higher standard in our work and supported a culture of shared responsibility and cooperation, while clearly communicating when personal opinions and perspectives should be voiced.</p>
